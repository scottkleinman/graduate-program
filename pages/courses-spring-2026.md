## Suggestions and Reminders

**All classes listed above are on-campus classes. CSUN does not offer fully online courses at the graduate level.**

Students should take **ENGL 507** (Introduction to Graduate Studies) in their first or second semester. **Registration for 507 is by permission number only.** Contact Frank de la Santo (frank.delasanto@csun.edu), our Graduate Support Coordinator, to request a permission number.

Creative Writing students ideally should take no more than one workshop per semester. Creative Writing students must take at least two workshops in their primary genre (narrative writing, poetry, or drama) in order to complete their MA degree.

**Graduate students may take only three 400-level courses for credit toward degree requirements.**

Fall 2024 classes that can fulfil the **Seminar in the Study of Language Core Requirement** for all three options include ENGL 513. Students may also take any 400, 500, or 600-level class in the Linguistics Department to fulfil this requirement (we recommend LING 510 - Foundational Concepts in Linguistics or LING 530 - Intro to TESL).

**ENGL 698D - Graduate Project** is a capstone class that most students in our program take to fulfil their Culminating Experience requirement. <span class="text-danger">It will not be offered in Fall 2026, so students who are near to completing their other requirements should plan to take it in Spring 2026. In order to enrol, you must be taking ENGL 698D in your final two semesters **after** having completed two graduate-level seminars that count towards the student's option. One of these courses may be the theory course for their option (ENGL 638, ENGL 651, or ENGL 652). Please consult the Graduate Adviser or the Graduate Coordinator if you are unsure whether you are eligible to enroll in ENGL 698D.</span>

Thinking of changing your option? You will probably need to consult with me to ensure that you will be able to fulfil the requirements for your new option in a timely manner. Once you have made the decision, you will need to fill out the [Change of Objective form](../assets/change_of_objective.pdf){target="_blank"} and submit it to Graduate Studies.
