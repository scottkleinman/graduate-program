I am Scott Kleinman, the English Graduate Adviser. I am hosting these resources on my own website because it is easier to maintain than the official CSUN website and because I can avoid some of the visual clutter of the CSUN template. Please note that official information is still available on the [English Department's Graduate Programs page](https://www.csun.edu/humanities/english/graduate-programs){target="_blank"}.

General information about the program is available on the [About page](/about). If you are new to the program, start with the [New Students page](/new-students).

For information on upcoming courses, click "Course Offerings" in the menu above.

**Advising:** I am currently working on setting my office hours for Fall 2025. In the meantime, if you have questions, please feel free to email me at [scott.kleinman@csun.edu](mailto:scott.kleinman@csun.edu). Note that many common questions can also be answered by our Graduate Coordinator, [Frank de la Santo](mailto:frank.delasanto@csun.edu), especially questions about administrative procedures.
